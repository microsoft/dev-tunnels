// Defines scopes for tunnel access tokens.
//
// A tunnel access token with one or more of these scopes typically also has cluster ID
// and tunnel ID claims that limit the access scope to a specific tunnel, and may also
// have one or more port claims that further limit the access to particular ports of the
// tunnel.

// Allows creating tunnels. This scope is valid only in policies at the global, domain, or
// organization level; it is not relevant to an already-created tunnel or tunnel port.
// (Creation of ports requires "manage" or "host" access to the tunnel.)

// Allows management operations on tunnels and tunnel ports.

// Allows management operations on all ports of a tunnel, but does not allow updating any
// other tunnel properties or deleting the tunnel.
pub const TUNNEL_ACCESS_SCOPES_MANAGE_PORTS: &str = "manage:ports";

// Allows accepting connections on tunnels as a host. Includes access to update tunnel
// endpoints and ports.

// Allows inspecting tunnel connection activity and data.
